# Backend API Test Results

## Testing CRUD Operations

### GET /clients
✅ Should work - basic functionality

### PUT /clients/:cedula  
❓ May have data formatting issues
- Frontend sends nested address object
- Backend expects flattened address fields

### DELETE /clients/:cedula
❓ May have routing issues
- Should work with proper error handling

## Potential Issues:

1. **Data Format Mismatch**: Frontend sends `address: { street: "..." }`, backend expects `street: "..."`
2. **Error Handling**: Need better error messages 
3. **CORS Issues**: May need additional CORS configuration
4. **Backend Cold Start**: Render backend may be sleeping (404 errors)

## Fixes Applied:

1. ✅ **Fixed UPDATE operation**: Flattened address data structure
2. ✅ **Enhanced error handling**: Added console logs and user alerts
3. ✅ **Improved data initialization**: Proper address object setup
4. ✅ **Added debugging**: Console logs for troubleshooting

## Next Steps:

1. Test the updated frontend
2. Check backend logs on Render
3. Verify database connection
4. Test with sample data
